平台主要为汽车厂商与具有个性化定制需求的购车用户，提供汽车个性化选购平台。不仅为提供提供可视化选择，也为厂商提供数据管理、产品分析等服务。

The platform mainly provides a personalized car purchase platform for automobile manufacturers and car buyers with personalized customization needs. It not only provides visual selection, but also provides data management, product analysis and other services for manufacturers.

首先完成注册工作，有经验的购车用户可以自行搭配爱车,调用Unity实现“颜色更换”与“车体旋转”可视化。

First, complete the registration. Experienced car buyers can match their cars by themselves, and call unity to realize the visualization of "color change" and "body rotation".

而购车小白可以通过自身需求，调用AHP算法进行智能推荐。在论坛上，买家之间可以随时进行信息交流，分享自己的购车经验，同时可以将购车问题反馈至厂商，进行保修等操作。

However, the inexperienced can call the AHP algorithm for intelligent recommendation according to his own needs. At the forum, buyers can exchange information at any time, share their own car purchase experience, and feed back the car purchase problems to the manufacturer for warranty and other operations.\
