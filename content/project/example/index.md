title: 千针万确—基于深度学习多模态图像引导智能静脉穿刺机器人
summary: Nowadays, **venipuncture** has been exclusively performed in both
  routine examinations and emergencies. however, it’s difficult to even for
  professional clinicians, for elder people, infants, or people in shock states.
  Meanwhile, the demand for an unmanned medical devices is increasing under
  regular epidemic control, to reduce the risk of
  cross-infection.  如今，静脉穿刺在常规检查和紧急情况下越来越普遍。然而，即使对于专业临床医生、老年人、婴儿或处于休克状态的人穿刺任务显得异常艰难。同时，在疫情时代，对无人医疗器械的需求正在增加，同时可以降低交叉感染的风险。

Nowadays, **venipuncture** has been exclusively performed in both routine examinations and emergencies. however, it’s difficult to even for professional clinicians, for elder people, infants, or people in shock states. Meanwhile, the demand for an unmanned medical devices is increasing under regular epidemic control, to reduce the risk of cross-infection.

Hence, our team from Tongji University started a project to invent a **venipuncture robot** called **Venibot**, which is compact, portable, and low cost.

This project has applied for **30+** patents. And we have made **2** prototypes and is now in cooperation with the University of Michigan, hoping to use bionic technology to achieve painless blood collection.
