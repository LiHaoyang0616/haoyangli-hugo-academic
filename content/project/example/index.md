Nowadays, **venipuncture** has been exclusively performed in both routine examinations and emergencies. however, it’s difficult to even for professional clinicians, for elder people, infants, or people in shock states. Meanwhile, the demand for an unmanned medical devices is increasing under regular epidemic control, to reduce the risk of cross-infection.

Hence, our team from Tongji University started a project to invent a **venipuncture robot** called **Venibot**, which is compact, portable, and low cost.

This project has applied for **30+** patents. And we have made **2** prototypes and is now in cooperation with the University of Michigan, hoping to use bionic technology to achieve painless blood collection.
