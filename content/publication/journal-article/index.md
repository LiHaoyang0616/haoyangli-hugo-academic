abstract: Visual object tracking has demonstrated multiple applications for
  UAVs. However, state-of-the-art tracking approaches mainly focus on daytime
  conditions from a single horizontal view, neglecting aerial nighttime
  conditions from various aerial viewpoints. This misalignment has caused a huge
  domain gap and constrained the automation of nighttime aerial tracking. To
  bridge the domain gap, this work proposes a multisource domain adaption
  network (MADNet). Specifically, abundant UAV daytime tracking viewpoints are
  introduced, forming the multi-source data with the general tracking benchmarks
  from a single horizontal view. Besides, a novel transformer feature aligner
  considers the multi-view feature and enhances the feature extraction. In
  addition, the tracker alignment method narrows the gap caused by various
  aerial viewpoints for a more robust tracker. Comprehensive experiments on
  three authoritative nighttime UAV tracking benchmarks and realworld tests
  validate the robustness and utility of MADNet at night from multiple
  perspectives. The source code locates on
